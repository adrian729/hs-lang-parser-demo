# Lang parser
Small language lexer and parser following the videos of [Introduction to Writing Modern Parsers - tylerlaceby](https://youtu.be/V77J9l8N-P8?si=4omd4bI1kLH9IGba).

- Tried to do the same that was done in Go but in Haskell, done in a far from optimal way.
- NOT done in a haskeller way, just done for some practice and fun to see if what was done in Go could be done in a similar way in Haskell and see the main issues and differences between the two languages.

## Future
- Next step would be to do it as it should be done with Haskell.
